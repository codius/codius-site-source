# Codius Features
Codius is an open hosting protocol, carrying with it all of the connotations that implies - distributed peer-to-peer hosting and third-party verified smart contracts. But Codius brings a host of its own features to the table as well, offering flexibility in distribution and development. Throw Interledger into the mix, and Codius adds flexibility in payments to its feature suite.

## Any Language, Any Case
Codius hosts run code via hardware-isolated virtual machines referred to as "pods". This means that developers can develop their code in any language they like, then configure a pod on a Codius host with an environment that is able to run said code.

Codius' hosting protocol is also run independently of any blockchains, which allows for a greater range of use cases on Codius. Developers can create apps that do not depend on or are more practical without a blockchain, granting them freedom to develop exactly the kind of app they wish to host.

## Freedom in Payment Method
Codius hosting's payment infrastructure is provided by Interledger, so users and developers can send or receive payments in the currency of their choosing.

## Flexibility in Distribution
Most hosting platforms require developers to make a choice between centralized hosting on a single provider, or completely decentralized hosting with every member of the network participating in hosting a developer's code. Codius puts both of these options - and anywhere in between - under a single umbrella. Developers can now choose exactly who to trust with hosting their code, and have total freedom on just how distributed they wish their code to be.

## Stronger Security
With the hardware isolation methods that Codius uses, hosts are protected from buggy code affecting their servers. Codius' independence from an underlying blockchain also means that any bad or poor code cannot directly threaten any potential blockchains that developers choose to integrate.

The design of Codius also allows for secure distribution - one can distribute a contract cotaining secrets or other sensitive information, while sitll preventing any one host of the contract from learning them.
