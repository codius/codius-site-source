# Decentralized Application Layer

Bitcoin and Ripple, among others, are decentralized ledgers that enable efficient value transfers and trustworthy storage because they are secure even in the face of actively malicious attackers. These systems are distributed, massively redundant, fault-tolerant databases.

If we want to create secure, distributed applications that can interact with different distributed databases, we need an easy way to deploy our code to multiple hosts.

Codius is the application layer for the decentralized web. Programs running on Codius can interact with one another, as well as distributed databases such as Ripple and Bitcoin and all other web services and APIs.
