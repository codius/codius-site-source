# What is Codius?

Codius makes it easy to develop applications that are:

* secure and distributed
* modular, forkable, and constantly improving
* integrated with web technologies
* independent of their developers

These are smart programs.

Smart programs can encode the logic of agreements or “smart contracts”, or their functionality can extend far beyond the realm of contracts. With Codius, smart programs can hold assets of their own on any or multiple cryptography-based ledgers, such as Bitcoin and XRP.
